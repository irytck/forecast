    "The results highlights a varying variance in the residuals, with lower variance from 2015–2020 and higher, more volatile variance afterward. This pattern suggests heteroscedasticity, which may impact the performance of an ARIMA model if left unaddressed. One common solution is to apply a log transformation (or sometimes a Box-Cox transformation) to stabilize the variance across the series. This transformation can help reduce the impact of extreme changes and make the series more suitable for ARIMA."
